# VR-Project - Panoramas On The Modern Web

This repository aimed initially to be a Concept of integration of VR Panoramas into [A-FRAME](https://aframe.io/) *[https://aframe.io/]* - A web framework for building virtual reality experiences. Now it goes quite a bit further...

> [!NOTE]  
> This branch is a remake of the legacy version made with marzinano, a discontinued 360 web viewer "for the modern web". We dumped that idea fast. Lol.
