Therefore, for streamlining the organization, I propose to provide you with a list of a few employees who, in my view, are dispensable in my department.\nI specifically identify three:\nmy secretary Isabelle P., the graphic designer Thierry A., and the person responsible for our online presence, Albert F.\nThis will allow the remaining 80% to seize the opportunity and stop bothering us with remote work. Thank you, in any case, for waiting until I return from vacation before making any public announcements, as the unions are likely to wake up.\nSincerely,\nMr. Dufront, Marketing Director",
